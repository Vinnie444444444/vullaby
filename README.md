This is a fork of a sample vulnerable java application developed by Cyber Security and Privacy Foundation.

The only modification done is updating the Maven source & target to 1.6 (for running with JDK 11). Change that if you are using newer/older Java. Note that using newer Java will require code changes.

You can scan it by SNYK, by simply creating your own fork and adding by adding a project from the SNYK dashboard.

To scan the application with Coverity Scan you would need to build it with the coverity scan build tool for java. For the installer and instructions how to build visit https://scan.coverity.com/download?tab=java
